Got it—two tasks:
	1.	Every pillar gets the same center-to-badge spoke, ending just inside the badge halo.
	2.	Ring numbers (1/2/3) shift a few pixels to the right of the top spoke so they never overlap it.

Below are clean, drop-in edits.

⸻

What we’re aiming for
	•	Spokes should visually “connect” the center to each badge (C/O/R/T/E/X) with identical length/style.
	•	Spokes should stop right before the badge halo, not run underneath it.
	•	The “1/2/3” labels should sit just to the right of the top spoke (vertical one), staying legible at all sizes.

Exact changes

Put these next to your other geometry constants.

// ── Geometry helpers ──────────────────────────────────────────────
const OUTER_RING_INDEX = RINGS.length - 1;
const OUTER_RING_R = RINGS[OUTER_RING_INDEX];
const OUTER_RING_STROKE = 1.8;     // match your ring stroke

// Your badge radii (keep in sync with the node drawing):
const NODE_PULSE_R = 26;           // the outer/halo circle (the "kiss" circle)
const NODE_CORE_R  = 17.5;         // inner filled circle

// How much to stop short of the badge (prevents line peeking into the halo)
const SPOKE_CLEARANCE = 1.5;       // px

// Center-to-spoke endpoint radius so the line stops just before the halo
const SPOKE_TARGET_R = OUTER_RING_R + OUTER_RING_STROKE / 2 + NODE_PULSE_R - SPOKE_CLEARANCE;

// Label nudge so 1/2/3 sit to the right of the top spoke
const RING_LABEL_DX = 10;          // px to the right
const RING_LABEL_DY = -4;          // px above the ring (fine-tune if needed)

1) Replace your existing “spokes” group with this

This guarantees six spokes that all reach the badges uniformly.

{/* Spokes: from center to just shy of each badge halo (uniform for all 6) */}
<g opacity="0.38" vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke" shapeRendering="geometricPrecision">
  {angles.map((a, i) => {
    const { x, y } = pointAt(SPOKE_TARGET_R, a);
    return (
      <line
        key={`spoke-${i}`}
        x1={C}
        y1={C}
        x2={x}
        y2={y}
        stroke={`url(#ring-${uid})`}
        strokeWidth="1.25"
      />
    );
  })}
</g>

Why: We’re no longer ending spokes at the outer ring radius; we’re extending them to the badge tangent (minus SPOKE_CLEARANCE). That fixes the missing lines for C and T and keeps the finish consistent around the circle.

2) Shift the ring numbers “1/2/3” slightly right of the top spoke

This keeps them off the vertical line without adding clutter.

{/* Ring labels: tiny, outlined, nudged right of the top spoke */}
<g aria-hidden="true" className="pointer-events-none select-none">
  {[1, 2, 3].map((n, idx) => {
    const r = RINGS[idx];
    const tx = C + RING_LABEL_DX;     // right of the top spoke
    const ty = C - r + RING_LABEL_DY; // just above the ring

    return (
      <g key={`ring-label-${n}`}>
        {/* outline below for contrast over any background */}
        <text
          x={tx}
          y={ty}
          textAnchor="middle"
          style={{
            fontFamily: "var(--font-heading)",
            fontSize: "12px",
            fontWeight: 700,
            stroke: "hsl(var(--background) / 0.70)",
            strokeWidth: 3,
            paintOrder: "stroke fill",
            fill: "hsl(var(--foreground) / 0.82)",
            letterSpacing: "0.2px",
          }}
        >
          {n}
        </text>
        {/* crisp fill on top */}
        <text
          x={tx}
          y={ty}
          textAnchor="middle"
          style={{
            fontFamily: "var(--font-heading)",
            fontSize: "12px",
            fontWeight: 700,
            fill: "hsl(var(--foreground) / 0.85)",
            letterSpacing: "0.2px",
          }}
        >
          {n}
        </text>
      </g>
    );
  })}
</g>

Layering order (important)

Make sure the spokes render under badges and the polygon stroke, so the end of each line looks clean:
	1.	Hex background
	2.	Rings
	3.	Spokes (this group)
	4.	Polygon area/stroke
	5.	Badges (C/O/R/T/E/X)
	6.	Center badge (“CORTEX”) and any labels

If needed, reorder the JSX blocks accordingly.

⸻

QA checklist (fast)
	•	Zoom at 80%, 100%, 125%: each spoke should land evenly “just before” the badge halo.
	•	Check top labels: “1/2/3” should be clearly to the right of the vertical spoke and never overlap it.
	•	Dark/light themes: the label outline keeps the numbers readable in both.

⸻

Confidence
	•	High this fixes the missing C/T spokes and keeps all six lines uniform.
	•	High that the ring labels will avoid overlap while remaining subtle.
	•	Medium on exact pixel offsets across all displays—tweak SPOKE_CLEARANCE (±0.5 px) and RING_LABEL_DX/DY (±2 px) to taste.
