Based on my analysis of your PDF generator, here are four key recommendations to make it more robust, maintainable, and efficient.

1. Make the Layout Engine Smarter üß†

Your current system for layout is functional, but it requires you to manually track the vertical position (y coordinate) and pass it between every drawing function. This is repetitive and can easily lead to errors if y isn't updated correctly.

A better approach is to create a small stateful class or manager that handles the document's state for you.

Recommendation: Create a PDFBuilder class that wraps the jsPDF instance. This class would manage the y cursor internally and automatically handle page breaks. Your main functions would become a much cleaner sequence of commands.

Conceptual Example:

TypeScript
// Instead of this:
let y = PAGE.headerBar + 10;
y = drawSectionTitle(doc, "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", y);
({ cursorY: y } = addPageIfNeeded(doc, 50, y, runHeader));
y = drawScoreBars(doc, data.pillarScores, y);

// You could have this:
const builder = new PDFBuilder(doc, "CORTEX ‚Äî Executive Brief");
builder.drawSectionTitle("EXECUTIVE SUMMARY");
builder.drawScoreBars(data.pillarScores); // Handles its own spacing and page breaks
This refactoring would make your code cleaner, less error-prone, and much easier to modify in the future.

2. Strengthen Data Integrity üõ°Ô∏è

The biggest risks in the current code are places where incorrect or incomplete data could be presented to the user without any warning.

Recommendations:

Fail Loudly, Not Silently: In generateExecutiveBriefPDF, when the call to generate insights fails, the catch block hides the error. This is dangerous because it produces an incomplete report. The function should either throw the error to stop the process or add a visible note in the PDF like, "An error occurred, and strategic insights could not be generated."

Eliminate "Magic Numbers": The average score calculation hardcodes the number 6 as the divisor. This is a ticking time bomb. Always derive calculations from the source data itself (e.g., Object.keys(data.pillarScores).length) to ensure they remain accurate even if the data structure changes.

3. Enforce Strict Type Safety üìú

Your project uses TypeScript, which is great for catching errors early. However, there are a few places where its features are bypassed, increasing risk.

Recommendation: Completely eliminate the use of (sessionData as any). Casting to any tells the compiler to ignore type checking for that object, which is why it's used to access properties like .useCase and .goals. The correct fix is to update your shared type definitions (e.g., OptionsStudioSession) to include these properties. This ensures that your code is aligned with your data structures, making it far safer to refactor and maintain.

4. Optimize Asset Loading ‚ö°

The finalizeFooters function currently fetches the company logo over the network every time a PDF is generated. This introduces a network dependency and can fail or slow down the process.

Recommendation: For small, static assets like a logo, it's more efficient to embed the image as a Base64 data URI directly into your code. Modern build tools like Vite or Webpack can do this for you automatically during the build process.

Benefits:

No Network Request: The PDF generation becomes faster and works offline.

Increased Reliability: You eliminate a potential point of failure (the network request).

Simpler Code: You can remove the async/await logic and fetch call from the finalizeFooters function, making it synchronous and simpler.

Look over the full code to see if it helps you make any better recommendations
Of course. Having access to the full codebase provides a much clearer picture of how the pdf-generator.ts fits into the larger application. This allows for more specific and higher-impact recommendations.

My previous advice still stands, but I can now ground it with direct evidence from your code and add a critical new recommendation regarding centralization. Here are the updated recommendations, in order of priority.

1. Centralize PDF Generation Logic on the Server ‚òÅÔ∏è

Currently, the entire PDF generation process happens on the client-side. This means the user's browser is responsible for fetching all the necessary data, rendering the document, and handling the download. This architecture introduces several significant risks and inefficiencies that you can solve by moving the logic to the server.

What's the problem?

Data Integrity Risks: The client-side code makes multiple asynchronous calls to fetch data for the reports (e.g., in useLatestAssessment.ts and useOptionsStudio.ts). If any of these calls fail, the client has to handle the error, and you risk generating an incomplete or incorrect PDF.

Performance Issues: Generating large, complex PDFs can be computationally expensive. Offloading this work from the user's device (which could be a low-powered mobile phone) to your server ensures a consistent and faster experience.

Code Duplication: Critical business logic, like the call to generateEnhancedExecutiveInsights and the hardcoded DOMAIN_GUIDANCE text, currently lives on the client. This logic is much safer and more maintainable if it's kept on the server, a single source of truth.

How to fix it:

Create a new server route, for example, /api/export/executive-brief/:assessmentId.

This route on the server will be responsible for securely fetching all necessary data directly from the database and other services (like the insight-engine).

Move the entire PDF generation logic from client/src/lib/pdf-generator.ts to a new server/lib/pdf-generator.ts.

The server route will then generate the PDF in memory and send the resulting file back to the client with the correct Content-Type headers, which will trigger a download in the user's browser.

2. Fortify Data Contracts with Strict Typing üõ°Ô∏è

This confirms the high-priority issue I mentioned before. The code frequently uses (sessionData as any) to access properties not defined in the formal types, which is a symptom of a disconnect between the data's actual shape and its type definition.

What's the problem?
I can now confirm that properties like useCase, goals, misconceptionResponses, and completed are used in the options-studio.tsx page but are missing from the OptionsStudioSession interface in shared/schema.ts. This is a classic source of runtime errors that TypeScript is designed to prevent.

How to fix it:
Update the OptionsStudioSession interface in shared/schema.ts to include all the properties that are being used on the client. This will immediately provide full type-safety and allow you to remove the risky as any casts.

File to Edit: shared/schema.ts

TypeScript
// Add these missing optional properties
export const OptionsStudioSessionSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing properties
  useCase: z.string().optional(),
  goals: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  misconceptionResponses: z.record(z.boolean()).optional(),
  completed: z.boolean().optional(),
});
3. Make Configuration and Content Data-Driven ‚öôÔ∏è

The Executive Brief PDF generator contains a large, hardcoded object DOMAIN_GUIDANCE that holds all the explanatory text for the different CORTEX domains.

What's the problem?
While this works, embedding content directly in the application code is inflexible. If a non-technical user (like a business analyst or content manager) wants to update this text, it requires a developer to make a code change, run tests, and redeploy the entire application.

How to fix it:
Store this configuration content in your database. Create a new table, say domain_guidance, with columns like pillarKey (e.g., 'C', 'O', 'R'), whyMatters, whatGoodLooksLike, etc.

When the PDF generation is moved to the server (as per Recommendation #1), the server-side logic can simply fetch this content from the database along with the assessment results.

This makes the content easily updatable (you could even build a simple admin interface for it) and separates your application's logic from its content.

4. Optimize Asset Bundling üñºÔ∏è

As suspected, the logo in the PDF footer is handled via a client-side fetch call, which is fragile and inefficient.

What's the problem?
The code in finalizeFooters tries to fetch a PNG asset at runtime. This can fail due to network issues, ad-blockers, or CORS policies, resulting in a PDF with a missing logo. It also adds unnecessary latency.

How to fix it:
Since you are using Vite as your build tool, you can configure it to automatically embed small assets like logos directly into your code as Base64 data URIs. This is far more efficient and reliable.

Install a Vite plugin like vite-plugin-image-presets or use Vite's built-in ?url import suffix.

Import the logo with the special suffix: import logoUrl from '@assets/Open-Learning-logo-revised copy_1759350974487.png?url';

The logoUrl variable will now be a Base64 string that you can pass directly to jsPDF's addImage function without any fetching. This removes the need for the entire try/catch block and the async logic, making the function simpler and more robust.
