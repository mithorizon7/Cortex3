Based on my analysis of your PDF generator, here are four key recommendations to make it more robust, maintainable, and efficient.

### 1\. Make the Layout Engine Smarter üß†

Your current system for layout is functional, but it requires you to manually track the vertical position (`y` coordinate) and pass it between every drawing function. This is repetitive and can easily lead to errors if `y` isn't updated correctly.

A better approach is to create a small **stateful class or manager** that handles the document's state for you.

**Recommendation:** Create a `PDFBuilder` class that wraps the `jsPDF` instance. This class would manage the `y` cursor internally and automatically handle page breaks. Your main functions would become a much cleaner sequence of commands.

**Conceptual Example:**

```typescript
// Instead of this:
let y = PAGE.headerBar + 10;
y = drawSectionTitle(doc, "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", y);
({ cursorY: y } = addPageIfNeeded(doc, 50, y, runHeader));
y = drawScoreBars(doc, data.pillarScores, y);

// You could have this:
const builder = new PDFBuilder(doc, "CORTEX ‚Äî Executive Brief");
builder.drawSectionTitle("EXECUTIVE SUMMARY");
builder.drawScoreBars(data.pillarScores); // Handles its own spacing and page breaks
```

This refactoring would make your code cleaner, less error-prone, and much easier to modify in the future.

### 2\. Strengthen Data Integrity üõ°Ô∏è

The biggest risks in the current code are places where incorrect or incomplete data could be presented to the user without any warning.

**Recommendations:**

  * **Fail Loudly, Not Silently:** In `generateExecutiveBriefPDF`, when the call to generate insights fails, the `catch` block hides the error. This is dangerous because it produces an incomplete report. The function should either **throw the error** to stop the process or **add a visible note** in the PDF like, "An error occurred, and strategic insights could not be generated."
  * **Eliminate "Magic Numbers":** The average score calculation hardcodes the number `6` as the divisor. This is a ticking time bomb. Always derive calculations from the source data itself (e.g., `Object.keys(data.pillarScores).length`) to ensure they remain accurate even if the data structure changes.

### 3\. Enforce Strict Type Safety üìú

Your project uses TypeScript, which is great for catching errors early. However, there are a few places where its features are bypassed, increasing risk.

**Recommendation:** Completely eliminate the use of `(sessionData as any)`. Casting to `any` tells the compiler to ignore type checking for that object, which is why it's used to access properties like `.useCase` and `.goals`. The correct fix is to **update your shared type definitions** (e.g., `OptionsStudioSession`) to include these properties. This ensures that your code is aligned with your data structures, making it far safer to refactor and maintain.

### 4\. Optimize Asset Loading ‚ö°

The `finalizeFooters` function currently fetches the company logo over the network every time a PDF is generated. This introduces a network dependency and can fail or slow down the process.

**Recommendation:** For small, static assets like a logo, it's more efficient to **embed the image as a Base64 data URI** directly into your code. Modern build tools like Vite or Webpack can do this for you automatically during the build process.

**Benefits:**

  * **No Network Request:** The PDF generation becomes faster and works offline.
  * **Increased Reliability:** You eliminate a potential point of failure (the network request).
  * **Simpler Code:** You can remove the `async`/`await` logic and `fetch` call from the `finalizeFooters` function, making it synchronous and simpler.
