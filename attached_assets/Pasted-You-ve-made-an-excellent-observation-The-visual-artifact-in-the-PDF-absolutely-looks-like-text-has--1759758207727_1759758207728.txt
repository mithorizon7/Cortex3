You've made an excellent observation. The visual artifact in the PDF absolutely looks like text has been rendered on top of other text, causing it to become an unreadable jumble. I've re-analyzed the code with that specific hypothesis in mind.

However, the code is structured to prevent this from happening. The issue still points back to the original data being corrupted before it's sent to the PDF generator.

Here’s a breakdown of why it's not an overlap issue and what the code shows:

Vertical Overlap is Prevented

The function drawBullets is responsible for writing each bullet point. It takes a starting vertical position (y) and carefully increments it after drawing each line of text.

Code Snippet (drawBullets function):

TypeScript
function drawBullets(doc: any, items: string[], ..., y: number, ...) {
  // ...
  for (const it of (items || [])) {
    // ... wraps the text into lines ...
    for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
      // ...
      doc.text(line, PAGE.margin + indent, y); // Draws text at current y
      y += PAGE.line; // << MOVES y DOWN for the next line
    }
    y += 1.5; // Adds extra space between bullet points
  }
  return y; // Returns the final y position
}
Analysis: As you can see, the y coordinate is strictly managed. It draws a line and then immediately moves down by a set amount (PAGE.line). This sequential process makes it impossible for the function to draw two bullet points from the same list on top of each other.

The "Smoking Gun"

The most compelling piece of evidence is in the PDF you provided. In the "Priority Actions" section, there are three bullet points: two are garbled, but the third one is perfectly legible:

Estherlessti AlatingsedgeDesignliangraosts. (Garbled)

Rrepritiatioprad pdætargettgen Aldaisaltępment. (Garbled)

Invest in secure, auditable edge MLOps. (Perfectly fine)

If the problem were a rendering bug like text overlapping, it would almost certainly affect all the bullet points in the list equally. The fact that one item renders correctly while the others don't strongly indicates that the code is working correctly, but the data for the first two items is bad.

Conclusion:

Your observation was sharp, but the evidence in the code and the final PDF confirms the original diagnosis. The problem is "Garbage In, Garbage Out."

The data.mirror.actions array that was used to generate that specific PDF contained two corrupted strings and one valid string. The PDF generator correctly rendered all three—it just happens that two of them were already unreadable.

My previous recommendation remains the correct course of action: The root cause must be fixed in the system that generates the data before it calls the generateSituationAssessmentBrief function.
