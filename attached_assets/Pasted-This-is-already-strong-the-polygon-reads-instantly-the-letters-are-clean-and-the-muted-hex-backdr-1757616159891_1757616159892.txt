This is already strong: the polygon reads instantly, the letters are clean, and the muted hex backdrop feels premium. For a hero, though, I’d tune a few things to make it **crisper, clearer, and more executive**—without getting busy.

## Quick wins (high impact, low effort)

1. **Sharpen the polygon & rings (reduce blur)**

   * Right now the Gaussian blur softens edges enough that it looks slightly out-of-focus on Retina.
   * Remove/reduce filter on the polygon stroke and add `vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke"` and `shapeRendering="geometricPrecision"` to keep lines crisp at any size.
   * Drop polygon fill to \~10–12% and keep stroke at \~2px with a subtle inner highlight (0.4px white at 12% opacity) for a “glass edge”.

2. **Dial back the hex pattern**

   * Lower opacity a touch (e.g., from \~0.07 to \~0.03–0.04) and increase pattern scale by \~20–30% to avoid moiré at large sizes.
   * Keep the center mask you’re using, but feather it a bit more so the texture doesn’t compete with the data in the focal area.

3. **Clarify the scale**

   * Add **tiny tick labels** for the rings (e.g., “1 • 2 • 3”) at the top or upper-left only—single placement avoids clutter but instantly tells viewers what the area means.
   * Keep ticks ultra-subtle: 10–20% opacity, 9–10px type.

4. **Lock color semantics**

   * Treat **grey = undeveloped**, **amber = developing**, **green = strong**. Your screenshot mostly follows that—good.
   * Ensure the greys for “R” and “X” still meet contrast (WCAG 4.5:1) against the background; if not, bump lightness contrast slightly or add a faint inner ring.

5. **Strengthen the center badge**

   * Increase the center “CORTEX” badge by \~10–12% and tighten letter-spacing very slightly. It should read as a seal, not a label.
   * Consider a micro-gradient rim (1px) to separate it from the polygon when the polygon passes close by.

6. **Reduce ambient glow on nodes**

   * The node halos look good but can bloom on some displays. Trim outer halo opacity \~15–20% and slow the pulse to \~6–8s to feel “alive” without drawing the eye away from the polygon.

## Optional (tasteful) upgrades

1. **Hover/Focus detail, not motion**

   * On node hover/focus: thicken that spoke + highlight the polygon edge between this node and its neighbors; show the full pillar name in a clean tooltip (“Culture”, “Operations”, etc.).
   * Keep transitions very slow (\~200–300ms, ease-out) to feel deliberate.

2. **Mini progress “donut” on each node (sub-scores)**

   * If you have sub-dimensions per pillar, a 270° mini arc (thin, 1–1.25px) around the node can show depth without clutter. Only visible on hover to keep the hero clean.

3. **Load animation**

   * Animate the polygon area from the center to the final levels over 600–800ms with a single ease; no bouncing. It communicates “measured growth” and looks premium.

4. **Copy cue under the graphic**

   * One 1-line caption in muted text: *“Composite example shown • Live scores update from your executive diagnostic.”*
   * This prevents the hero from being misread as *their* score.

## Concrete tweaks (drop-in snippets)

**Crisper polygon & rings**

```jsx
<g>
  {RINGS.map((r,i)=>(
    <circle
      key={r}
      cx={C}
      cy={C}
      r={r}
      fill="none"
      stroke={`url(#ring-${uid})`}
      strokeWidth={i===RINGS.length-1?1.5:1}
      vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke"
      shapeRendering="geometricPrecision"
      opacity={i===0?0.6:i===1?0.45:0.35}
    />
  ))}
</g>

<g>
  <polygon
    points={polygonPoints}
    fill="hsl(var(--primary)/0.12)"
    stroke={`url(#poly-${uid})`}
    strokeWidth="2"
    vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke"
    shapeRendering="geometricPrecision"
    style={{ filter: "none" }} // remove heavy blur
  />
  {/* 1px inner highlight for glass edge */}
  <polygon
    points={polygonPoints}
    fill="none"
    stroke="white"
    strokeOpacity="0.12"
    strokeWidth="0.6"
    vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke"
  />
</g>
```

**Subtler hex pattern**

```jsx
<g opacity="0.04" mask={`url(#fadeMask-${uid})`}>
  <rect width={VB} height={VB} fill={`url(#hex-${uid})`} />
</g>
```

**Ring scale labels (single placement, tiny)**

```jsx
{/* Place at top ring, slightly inward */}
<g aria-hidden="true">
  {[1,2,3].map((n,idx)=>{
    const r = RINGS[idx];
    return (
      <text
        key={n}
        x={C}
        y={C - r - 6}
        textAnchor="middle"
        className="text-[10px] font-medium"
        style={{ fill: "hsl(var(--muted-foreground))", opacity: 0.6 }}
      >
        {n}
      </text>
    );
  })}
</g>
```

**Node halos trimmed & slow pulse**

```jsx
<circle
  cx={pos.x}
  cy={pos.y}
  r="26"
  className="animate-[pulse_7s_ease-in-out_infinite] motion-reduce:animate-none"
  fill={color}
  fillOpacity="0.08"       // was ~0.10
  stroke={color}
  strokeWidth="1.5"
  style={{ filter: `url(#soft-${uid})` }}
/>
```

**Accessibility & performance touches**

* Add `aria-describedby` to tie the hero to a short caption.
* Ensure all strokes use `vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke"` for crispness.
* Prefer CSS for any long-running animations; keep SVG filters minimal to stay GPU-light.
* Provide a static `<picture>` fallback (`.webp` @2x) for very small screens.

---

## Verdict

* **Keep**: the overall composition, the polygon-first read, the subtle background texture, and your color semantics (grey/amber/green).
* **Tighten**: blur/softness, background texture strength, and add minimal scale labels.
* **Optional flourish**: on-hover pillar details and a calm load-in animation.

### Confidence

* **High** on the visual/UX tweaks improving executive readability and polish.
* **High** that the crisping and pattern adjustments will look better on Retina and avoid moiré.
* **Medium** on adding sub-score donuts—great if you have data, but optional for launch.
