What file from me repo could I copy and send to you to make sure it's not a client side issue on my side?

That's a very smart approach! To help determine if the problem is originating from your client-side code, the most helpful files would be those directly involved in:

Initializing Firebase and Firebase Authentication.

Triggering the authentication process (e.g., when a user clicks a "Sign in with Google" button).

Handling the authentication response or errors.

Based on common web app structures using TypeScript/JavaScript, these are typically:

Your Firebase Initialization File: This is often a file like firebase.ts , firebase-config.ts , or src/lib/firebase.ts (or .js extensions). It's where you call initializeApp and likely export your auth instance (e.g., getAuth() ).

Why it's important: We need to ensure initializeApp is called correctly with your project's configuration (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, appId).

Your Authentication Service/Component File: This might be a file like auth.ts , Login.tsx , or the component/page where your login button resides. It contains the logic for invoking authentication methods like signInWithPopup or signInWithRedirect for Google.

Why it's important: We want to see how you're calling the Firebase Auth methods, how you're handling promises or async/await, and how any errors are caught and processed.

What to look for in the code:

When you share it, I'd be looking for:

How your Firebase configuration variables (apiKey, projectId, etc.) are being passed to initializeApp .

The exact Firebase Auth method you're using (e.g., signInWithPopup(auth, provider) or signInWithRedirect(auth, provider) ).

Any custom error handling or middleware you have around the authentication calls.

Please remember that I cannot execute code, but I can review it for common patterns, potential misconfigurations, or logical errors that might contribute to the "auth/internal-error" .

Feel free to copy and paste the relevant sections or files.
