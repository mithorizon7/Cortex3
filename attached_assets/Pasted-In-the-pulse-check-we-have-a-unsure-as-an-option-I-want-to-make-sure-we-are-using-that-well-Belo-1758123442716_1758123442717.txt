In the pulse check we have a "unsure" as an option. I want to make sure we are using that well. Below is guidance; 

reat Unsure = 0 for maturity, and track it separately as a “knowledge gap/confidence” signal that appears in the results and export.

Below is the full recommendation with copy, UX, and implementation details.

⸻

Why include Unsure?
	•	Honesty over guesswork. Executives often don’t know the ground truth for a specific control or practice. “Unsure” prevents forced, inaccurate Yes/No choices.
	•	Better signal. It distinguishes “we don’t do this” (No) from “we may do this, but I don’t know” (Unsure). That’s useful in a one-off workshop.
	•	Follow-up focus. Knowledge gaps are action-worthy (who to ask / what to verify) without changing the maturity picture.

⸻

Scoring rule (keep maturity simple)
	•	Each domain has 3 items → score = count(Yes) → 0–3.
	•	No and Unsure both contribute 0 to maturity.
	•	Separately compute knowledge gaps: gaps = count(Unsure) per domain (0–3).

Rationale: Maturity reflects established practice, not uncertainty. We still surface uncertainty visibly.

⸻

Results visualization (make Unsure useful, not punitive)
	•	Honeycomb: fill is based on score (0–3) as before.
	•	Confidence/Gap overlay: if a domain has 1–3 Unsure, apply a subtle dotted overlay or hatched ring and show a small caption:
	•	“Confidence: High” (0 unsure)
	•	“Confidence: Medium” (1 unsure)
	•	“Confidence: Low” (≥2 unsure)
	•	Export: include a short table of Unsure items per domain (“Follow-ups”), not as tasks—just prompts.

UI & copy (drop-in)

Answer choices (radio group)
	•	Yes
	•	No
	•	Unsure

Helper text under the section header

Mark “Yes” only if it is true across your organization today and you could point to evidence if asked. Use “Unsure” if you’re not certain.

Per-item tooltip (optional)

Unsure means you’re not confident either way. We’ll flag it as a follow-up and it won’t affect your score.

Results chip (per domain)
	•	e.g., “C — Score 2/3 · Confidence: Medium (1 unsure)”
