Absolutely—let’s replace the current “marketing landing page” with a calm, authoritative **Executive Onboarding** front page that sets expectations, builds trust, and moves leaders directly into the CORTEX workflow. Below is a complete design + copy package you can hand to the developer. It **does not** change functionality or routing; it only re-styles and rewrites the home screen to reflect an already‑paid, MIT‑led executive experience.

## Front Page Redesign — Executive Onboarding (Non‑Marketing)

### Design Goals (what this page must communicate)

1. **You’re in the right room.** This is an MIT‑run, high‑trust, executive‑level exercise—no selling, no hype.
2. **What will happen.** In \~15 minutes you’ll complete a short context profile and a pulse check, then receive an actionable snapshot.
3. **How we’ll use results.** For today’s workshop; exportable; not a compliance score; no benchmarking claims.
4. **How we treat your data.** Minimal collection; no PII; secure; you control the export.
5. **Start with confidence.** One primary action: **Begin**.

### Information Architecture (single screen; no scroll-jacking)

**Above the fold**

* MIT identity strip (subtle)
* Title + succinct purpose statement
* Three-step overview with time/cadence
* Primary action button (Begin)
* Secondary: “View methodology” and “Glossary”

**Below the fold (optional content that reassures)**

* “What you’ll get today” (snapshot card with key deliverables)
* “Your data & privacy” (plain-language assurances)
* “How we’ll use this in the session” (expectations)
* Small “Facilitator note” if you’re running a guided session

## Content (ready-to-paste copy)

### Page Title & Purpose

**CORTEX™ — Executive AI‑Readiness Snapshot**
**A focused, two‑step assessment to align leadership and surface your next best moves.**
This session is designed for decision‑makers. You’ll complete a brief context profile and an 18‑question pulse check. Your results produce a clear view across six domains—Clarity, Operations, Risk, Talent, Ecosystem, and Experimentation—followed by concise guidance and an export you can share.

### Three-Step Overview (compact, above the fold)

**Step 1 — Context (4–5 minutes)**
A short profile of your operating environment (e.g., regulation, data sensitivity, pace). This does **not** change your scores; it only tailors guidance and flags non‑negotiables.

**Step 2 — Pulse Check (6–8 minutes)**
18 binary questions across the six CORTEX pillars. Answer **Yes** only if it’s fully true today.

**Step 3 — Results (5–10 minutes)**
A honeycomb snapshot of maturity (0–3 per pillar), context “gates” to heed before scaling, and practical guidance you can use immediately. Export as PDF/JSON.

### Primary Action

**\[ Begin Assessment ]**
(Subtext: \~15 minutes total · No PII collected)

### Secondary Links (right-aligned or beneath the button)

* **View methodology** → opens a drawer/modal with a one‑page explainer (what CORTEX measures, what it doesn’t)
* **Glossary** → HITL, CoE, RACI, SLA, etc.

### What You’ll Get Today (card, below the fold)

**Your CORTEX Snapshot**

* A **honeycomb maturity view** across six executive domains
* **Context “gates”** (non‑negotiables) if you operate in higher‑risk settings
* **Guidance cards** per domain: why it matters, what good looks like, how to improve
* **Export** (PDF/JSON) — suitable for the executive team or board materials

*(No vendor pitching; no benchmarks unless a cohort study is explicitly enabled.)*

### Your Data & Privacy (card, below the fold)

* We collect **only** small integers/booleans (no free‑text PII).
* Results are **yours**: export/download is available at the end.
* If you provided an organization name, it appears only on your export.
* Optional cohort comparisons are disabled by default.

### How This Will Be Used in Today’s Session (card, below the fold)

* We’ll use your results to **focus discussion** on the weakest domains.
* “Gates” ensure we don’t scale with blind spots (e.g., safety, compliance).
* We’ll highlight **two moves** most likely to raise value in the next quarter.
* No one is graded. This is a **snapshot**, not a compliance score.

### Facilitator Note (small, muted)

If you are completing this on behalf of a team, gather input from: your technology lead, a risk/assurance contact, and one business unit owner. You can amend answers during the discussion.

## Visual & Interaction Design (applies to the home page only)

### Tone & Layout

* **Minimal, academic, confident.** Neutral background, disciplined grid, generous white space.
* **No marketing cards** (logos, “trusted by” banners, growth slogans).
* One **primary** action; secondary actions are text links or quiet buttons.
* **Dark mode** follows the same structure with guarded contrast.

### Components & Placement (map to your repo)

* **App Header** (`client/src/components/navigation/app-header.tsx`)

  * Replace any sales language with a thin identity strip:

    * Left: CORTEX wordmark + “MIT Open Learning” text lockup
    * Right: a very subtle “Help” icon (opens glossary)

* **Home Page Shell** (`client/src/pages/home.tsx`)

  * Replace hero with a **two-column** above‑the‑fold:

    * **Left (copy column):** Title, purpose, three-step overview, actions
    * **Right (visual column):** Static honeycomb motif (muted), not animated
  * Below the fold: three horizontal cards (“What you’ll get,” “Your data & privacy,” “How this will be used”) with consistent density

* **Buttons** (`@/components/ui/button.tsx`)

  * Primary cardinal; secondary ghost.
  * Motion: 150ms ease; slight scale (1.01) on hover.

* **Cards** (`@/components/ui/card.tsx`)

  * Increased padding (`p-6 md:p-8`), border subtle (`border-border`), shadow none/light.
  * Title (`text-xl font-medium`), body (`text-sm text-muted-foreground`), bullet spacing (`space-y-2`).

### Tailwind Class Sketch (for the hero)

```

### Micro‑interactions

* Subtle button hover (scale 1.01, 150ms).
* Card titles reveal a faint underline on hover.
* “View methodology” opens a side drawer (Radix `Dialog` or `Sheet`) with the one‑page explainer.
* Respect reduced‑motion preferences.

### Accessibility

* Accessible headings and landmarks.
* High contrast for all text (WCAG AA).
* Links and buttons have visible focus states (accent blue outline).
* Provide alt text for the honeycomb motif (“Decorative preview of the six‑pillar maturity view”).

## Methodology Drawer (one‑page explainer content)

**CORTEX in one page**

* **What it measures:** Six executive domains (Clarity, Operations, Risk, Talent, Ecosystem, Experimentation).
* **How scoring works:** Each pillar is 0–3 based on three binary statements.
* **What the context profile does:** Tailors guidance and flags non‑negotiables (“gates”) in higher‑risk environments; **never** changes your scores.
* **What you should expect today:** A snapshot to align leadership on where to focus next, plus an export you can share.
* **What it is not:** Not a compliance rating, not a vendor evaluation.
* **How to interpret “gates”:** They are prerequisites (e.g., human‑in‑the‑loop for safety‑critical use‑cases) to satisfy before scaling.

---

## Developer Implementation Checklist (home page only)

1. **Replace marketing hero** in `client/src/pages/home.tsx` with the structure above.

   * Use `Card` for the three reassurance sections below the fold.
   * Keep route for **Begin** → `/context` (existing flow).
2. **Add Methodology Drawer** using `@/components/ui/sheet` or `dialog`.

   * Content as supplied above; no dynamic data needed.
3. **Remove/disable any “Trusted By / Logos / CTA to book”** sections.
4. **Header:** adjust `AppHeader` to a slim identity bar (no marketing nav).
5. **Dark mode:** ensure tokens from your design system are applied (no additional styles needed beyond variables).
6. **QA:** Verify tab order, focus states, and mobile layout (the visual honeycomb block can collapse under the hero copy on small screens).
7. **Copy centralization:** Put strings in a small constants file for future i18n.

---

## Why this works for your audience

* **Non-pushy:** No selling; respects attention; concise.
* **Credible and calm:** Reads like a briefing, not a promo.
* **Actionable:** Sets clear expectations; makes the single “Begin” action obvious.
* **Consistent with program logic:** Mirrors the CORTEX flow (Context → Pulse → Results) without revealing implementation details or over‑promising.
* **On-brand for MIT:** Precision, restraint, quality.

If you want, I can also provide the exact JSX replacement for `home.tsx` with your shadcn imports and tailwind classes, but the structure above should be enough to implement quickly without touching any backend or assessment logic.&#x20;
