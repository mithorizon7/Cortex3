You’re 95% there. The content pack is complete **except** for one critical piece you’ll want in the site copy itself: the **exact text of the 18 Pulse questions**. I referenced them (“you already have them”) to keep the answer short, but for a hand‑off to engineering we should include the authoritative wording and stable IDs so they don’t have to hunt.

I’ve added them below in the same format as the rest of the pack. Everything else (welcome copy, context anchors, results headings, domain cards, pillar/gate micro‑guides, metric tooltips, glossary, export sections, facilitator prompts) is present and wired with IDs. No further changes needed after you drop in the Pulse block.

## Pulse‑Check 18 — Authoritative Copy (add to Section 3)

> **IDs:** `pulse.C1` … `pulse.X3`
> **Instruction reminder:** Answer **Yes** only if fully true **today**.

### Clarity & Command (C)

**ID:** `pulse.C1`

### Operations & Data (O)

**ID:** `pulse.O1`
**Text:** All AI solutions you operate or consume follow a documented lifecycle with performance logging, alerts for issues/drift, and **HITL/QA where risk warrants**.

**ID:** `pulse.O2`
**Text:** Key data or prompts feeding those solutions have documented owners, lineage, and quality standards in an accessible catalogue/register.

**ID:** `pulse.O3`
**Text:** Every new AI idea—build or buy—passes a standardized **value/feasibility gate** before major spend or effort.

### Risk, Trust, Security & Assurance (R)

**ID:** `pulse.R1`
**Text:** A living inventory lists each AI system or vendor service with risk level and a named risk owner.

**ID:** `pulse.R2`
**Text:** High‑impact AI undergoes scheduled fairness, privacy, and performance checks **and** periodic security red‑teaming.

**ID:** `pulse.R3`
**Text:** AI controls have been reviewed (internal audit or third‑party assurance) within the last 12 months, and an **incident response & communications plan** exists.

### Talent & Culture (T)

**ID:** `pulse.T1`
**Text:** A written plan exists to attract, develop, and retain the AI‑related skills the strategy requires.

**ID:** `pulse.T2`
**Text:** Most AI‑touching roles completed role‑appropriate training in the last 12 months **and** tasks have been **redesigned** to use AI safely/productively.

**ID:** `pulse.T3`
**Text:** AI wins, failures, and lessons are shared organization‑wide on a regular rhythm, with incentives that reward safe, effective adoption.

### Ecosystem & Infrastructure (E)

**ID:** `pulse.E1`
**Text:** Compute/licence/API capacity scales to demand, and **FinOps** visibility prevents delays or budget surprises.

**ID:** `pulse.E2`
**Text:** You maintain strategic model/tool/data partners **and** documented exit/portability plans to avoid lock‑in.

**ID:** `pulse.E3`
**Text:** Data exchanged with external parties flows only through governed, auditable, interoperable mechanisms (e.g., secure APIs, clean rooms).

**ID:** `pulse.X1`
**Text:** Business teams have access to a safe sandbox with representative data **and** a structured practice of external scanning.

**ID:** `pulse.X2`

**Verdict:** With the Pulse block added above, the content set is complete for a two‑hour, one‑off snapshot experience with credible depth, educational guidance, and strong exports. No other changes needed.
