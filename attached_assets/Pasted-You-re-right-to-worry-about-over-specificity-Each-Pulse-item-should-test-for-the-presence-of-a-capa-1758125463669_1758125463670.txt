You’re right to worry about over‑specificity. Each Pulse item should test for the presence of a capability or control, not a single implementation. Below is a line‑by‑line review of all 18 items and a cleaned, principle‑level v3.3 wording that preserves rigor while avoiding prescription and jargon.

⸻

How I evaluated each item
	•	Scope: Does it test the capability (what) rather than a specific method (how)?
	•	Clarity: Is it plainly understandable by senior leaders?
	•	Jargon: Any terms that require insider knowledge?
	•	Verifiability: Could a “Yes” be evidenced (policy, artifact, log, minutes)?

I keep Yes/No/Unsure (Unsure = 0 for score; shown as confidence).

Pulse v3.3 — Principle‑Level Wording (ready to use)

Answer Yes only if it is fully true today and you could point to evidence.
Key term tooltips suggested at the end.

C — Clarity & Command

C1 (v3.3)
A short, written AI ambition exists and names the business outcomes it aims to move.
Why change? Keeps focus on outcomes; “approved” can be implicit if published by leadership.
Acceptable evidence: one‑page ambition; strategy deck; OKRs.

C2 (v3.3)
A single senior leader is accountable for AI outcomes, and responsibilities between the central enablement team and business units are defined.
Why change? Replaces “CoE↔BU” jargon; allows any org design with clear roles.
Evidence: org memo/RACI; charter; budget line.

C3 (v3.3)
AI work is reviewed on a set schedule and those reviews lead to resource shifts (fund, pause, stop, or scale).
Why change? Removes “twice per year” prescription; keeps the crucial reallocation behavior.
Evidence: review calendar; minutes showing reallocation.

⸻

O — Operations & Data

O1 (v3.3)
AI solutions you run or consume follow a repeatable operating process that tracks quality, reliability, and cost, with human review where stakes are high.
Why change? Generalizes “documented lifecycle / logging / drift / HITL” into capability; keeps human‑in‑the‑loop concept in plain English.
Evidence: runbook/lifecycle doc; dashboards; alert rules; QA checkpoints.

O2 (v3.3)
The key data and prompts these solutions rely on have named owners, usage rules, and quality expectations that are easy to find.
Why change? Avoids “catalogue/register” prescription while preserving governance.
Evidence: data catalog entries; ownership matrix; retention rules.

O3 (v3.3)
New AI ideas—build or buy—pass a simple value and feasibility screen before major spend or effort.
Why change? Replaces “value/feasibility gate” jargon with plain words.
Evidence: intake form/template; portfolio log with decision notes.

⸻

R — Risk, Trust & Security

R1 (v3.3)
You keep an up‑to‑date list of AI systems and vendor services, with risk level and a named risk owner for each.
Why change? None—already capability‑level.
Evidence: inventory/register; owner assignments.

R2 (v3.3)
Higher‑impact uses are checked on a schedule for fairness, privacy, and quality, and your critical systems are periodically security‑tested.
Why change? “Red‑teaming” renamed to “security‑tested” to avoid jargon; keeps the intent.
Evidence: test calendar; findings and fixes; security test summary.

R3 (v3.3)
Your AI controls have had a recent independent review (internal or external), and you have a short incident response and communications plan.
Why change? Swaps “within 12 months” for “recent” to fit varied regimes; retains assurance + IR.
Evidence: audit/assurance letter; IR runbook.

⸻

T — Talent & Culture

T1 (v3.3)
A written plan exists to attract, develop, and retain the AI‑related skills your strategy requires.
Why change? None.

T2 (v3.3)
People in AI‑touching roles have had role‑appropriate training in the last year, and key workflows were updated to use AI safely and productively.
Why change? Replaces “tasks redesigned” with broader “workflows”; keeps timeframe.
Evidence: training records; updated SOPs/checklists.

T3 (v3.3)
Wins, failures, and lessons from AI use are shared on a regular rhythm, and incentives support safe, effective adoption.
Why change? None.

⸻

E — Ecosystem & Infrastructure

E1 (v3.3)
Capacity and licences scale with demand, and you have clear visibility into unit costs and quotas so projects are not delayed or surprised by spend.
Why change? Removes “FinOps” jargon; keeps cost discipline.
Evidence: cost dashboard; quota reports; SLOs.

E2 (v3.3)
You have strategic model/tool/data partners, and for critical paths you know how you would export, switch, or run a secondary option.
Why change? Keeps portability without prescribing contract terms.
Evidence: contract clauses; exit/second‑source notes.

E3 (v3.3)
Data you exchange with external parties uses governed, auditable routes (for example, approved APIs or clean‑room arrangements).
Why change? Clarifies with “for example”; avoids implying only one method.
Evidence: API gateway policy; data‑sharing agreement.

⸻

X — Experimentation & Evolution

X1 (v3.3)
Teams can experiment safely in a defined space, and you maintain a simple practice for scanning what’s changing outside (tech, policy, competitors).
Why change? Plain English for “sandbox” + “horizon scanning.”
Evidence: sandbox guidelines; short scan notes.

X2 (v3.3)
A small, protected slice of time, budget, or credits is reserved for exploratory or high‑uncertainty work each year.
Why change? None—capability, not method.

X3 (v3.3)
Every pilot has clear success and stop criteria with a decision date, and pilots that don’t meet the mark are retired or redirected on time.
Why change? Keeps “sunset logic” but uses plain words.
Evidence: pilot register with metrics and decision outcomes.

Items that were most at risk of being too specific
	•	O1 (lifecycle/logging/drift/HITL) → reframed as “repeatable operating process that tracks quality/reliability/cost + human review where stakes are high.”
	•	O2 (catalog/register) → reframed to “owners, usage rules, and quality expectations that are easy to find.”
	•	O3 (“value/feasibility gate”) → reframed as “simple value and feasibility screen.”
	•	R2 (“red‑teaming”) → reframed as “security‑tested” with examples; still allows red‑team, pen test, or equivalent.
	•	R3 (“within 12 months”) → “recent independent review,” respectful of different regimes.
	•	E1 (“FinOps”) → replaced with “clear visibility into unit costs and quotas.”
	•	X1 (“sandbox” and “scanning”) → kept concepts, simplified language.

These changes preserve the signal while allowing multiple valid implementations.

⸻

Minimal glossary for the few terms we still use (tooltips)
	•	Central enablement team: A small group that sets standards and supports the organization in using AI (often called a Center of Excellence).
	•	Human review (HITL): A person checks/approves outputs for higher‑stakes use‑cases.
	•	Data catalogue: A place to find what data exists, who owns it, and how to use it.
	•	Clean room: A controlled way to join data with a partner without sharing raw data.

⸻

Developer notes (quick)
	•	Replace the existing prompt strings with v3.3 above.
	•	Keep the Unsure choice; score only “Yes.”
	•	Show a tiny info icon next to “central enablement team,” “human review,” and “clean room,” revealing the glossary lines above.
	•	Keep the “evidence you could point to” list hidden by default; reveal on hover or via a small “What counts as evidence?” link.

⸻

Bottom line

The v3.3 set tests for capabilities and disciplines, not single solutions. Language is plain, verifiable, and implementation‑agnostic, so leaders won’t feel boxed into a method but will still know exactly what “Yes” means.
