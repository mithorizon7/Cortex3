Below is a complete upgrade of DECIDE as a learner‑focused, educational program that personalizes to each company without turning into prescriptive consulting. It’s written to be developer‑ready (components, flow, logic) and facilitator‑friendly (2‑hour session fit). It integrates smoothly with your existing CORTEX stack and brand tone.

⸻

A) What we’re building (and what changed)

New intent: DECIDE becomes Options Studio — a short, self‑contained learning experience that teaches leaders the major AI solution patterns, when they’re useful, trade‑offs, and myths. It personalizes emphasis using the Context Profile, but it does not tell them what to do.

Upgrades vs. prior concept
	•	Replace the “weighted recommendation” feel with Seven Lenses learners use to understand trade‑offs (no numeric scoring or hard advice).
	•	Expand to a clear, minimal option set (below) + cross‑cutting disciplines that always matter (assurance/evals).
	•	Add misconception checks, scenario toggles, and reflection prompts to lock in understanding.
	•	Output a learning dossier: what they explored, where they landed conceptually, and questions to pursue—not a task plan.

⸻

B) The option set (what we teach)

Nine options total: complete enough to cover 95% of real decisions, still simple.
Each option uses the same card template: What it is · Best for · Not ideal when · Prerequisites · Relative timeline (⚡ speed / 🏗 build effort / 🏃 ops) · Data needs · Risks & safety · KPIs to watch · Common myth vs reality.

	1.	Off‑the‑Shelf AI Apps (copilots, vertical SaaS)
	2.	API Orchestration & Prompt Libraries (no training; function calling; tools)
	3.	Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)
	4.	Agentic Workflows & Orchestrators (tool‑use, multi‑step plans)
	5.	Light Fine‑Tuning (LoRA/adapters; style/format/domain behavior)
	6.	Heavy Fine‑Tuning / Domain Model (specialized, data‑rich cases)
	7.	Private Hosting / VPC (control, residency, isolation)
	8.	Small Models at the Edge (latency/offline; on‑device)
	9.	Classical ML / Rules / RPA (structured, deterministic baselines)

Cross‑cutting disciplines (always on, not options):
	•	Assurance & Evals Layer (guardrails, red‑team, drift, HITL where needed)
	•	Data Stewardship (rights, quality, lineage, retention)
	•	Portability & Exit (avoid brittle lock‑in; second‑source for critical paths)

We keep “pretraining a foundation model” as a footnote in Agentic/Heavy FT cards (“for labs/hyperscalers only”).

⸻

C) The Seven Lenses (educational axes, not scores)

Leaders “learn by seeing” each option through these seven lenses. These replace prescriptive DECIDE weights:
	1.	Speed‑to‑Value (days → months)
	2.	Customization & Control (OOTB → deeply tailored)
	3.	Data Leverage (uses your knowledge/data?)
	4.	Risk & Compliance Load (governance/assurance effort)
	5.	Operational Burden (people/process to run it)
	6.	Portability & Lock‑in (ease of switching later)
	7.	Cost Shape (fixed vs variable; predictability)

Personalization (light): We highlight certain lenses per the Context Profile (e.g., high regulation → accent Risk & Compliance lens; low readiness → Operational Burden warnings). We do not compute a “best choice.”

⸻

D) Learner‑focused UX (flow & pedagogy)

Total time: 25–40 minutes (fits neatly in your 2‑hour session).
	1.	Orientation (2 min)
	•	Short intro: “You’ll explore AI solution patterns using Seven Lenses. We’ll tailor emphasis to your context; we won’t prescribe a choice.”
	2.	Misconception Check (3–5 min)
	•	Five T/F questions (e.g., “Fine‑tuning fixes hallucinations?” → False, explain). Immediate feedback with 1‑line rationale and links to the relevant option card.
	3.	Pick a Situation (2–3 min) (Optional but powerful)
	•	“Which problem are you thinking about?” A one‑line use‑case name + choose up to 2 goals (speed / quality / compliance / cost).
	•	Purpose: anchor learning; does not change scores or force an answer.
	4.	Option Exploration (10–20 min)
	•	Option Grid (cards). Each card shows: “What it is,” “Best for,” two lens badges, “Myth vs Reality.”
	•	Click → Drawer deep dive (the full template).
	•	Compare two options → shows Seven Lenses plot (dots on 0–4 scale) + side‑by‑side “Best for / Not ideal.”
	•	Scenario toggle (reads Context Profile): if regulatory_intensity ≥ 3 or safety ≥ 3, display a Caution chip on options that normally require HITL/assurance; if build_readiness ≤ 1, display “Build later” chip on fine‑tuning cards; if latency_edge ≥ 3, display Edge/Offline reminders.
	5.	Mini‑Reflection (3–5 min)
	•	“Given your situation, which two options feel most promising to learn more about, and why?”
	•	“What lens mattered most to you?” (Select one or two).
	•	Saves to the export; no advice, just the learner’s conclusions.
	6.	Takeaway (1–2 min)
	•	Download “Options Studio Summary”: the two options they favor and why, the lenses they prioritized, myths they corrected, and glossary.

Learning design techniques used:
	•	Advance organizer (Seven Lenses) → sets mental model.
	•	Retrieval practice (misconception check) → challenge prior beliefs.
	•	Worked examples (option cards) → concrete templates.
	•	Metacognition (reflection) → internalize and transfer.
	•	Dual coding (lens visual + text) → improved retention.

⸻

E) Personalization rules (transparent, non‑prescriptive)

Context Profile → emphasis (not scoring):
	•	Regulatory ≥ 3 OR Safety ≥ 3
	•	Add “HITL + Assurance required before scale” banner on: API, RAG, Agents, Fine‑tuning, Hosting, Edge.
	•	Risk & Compliance lens is highlighted (label: “Based on your context”).
	•	Data Sensitivity ≥ 3
	•	Add “Residency & retention apply” note on: RAG, Fine‑tuning, Hosting.
	•	Show a Portability & Data‑use note on Off‑the‑shelf/API cards.
	•	Build Readiness ≤ 1
	•	Add “Build later” note on Light/Heavy FT.
	•	Emphasize Off‑the‑Shelf, API, and RAG as learning baselines, not prescriptions.
	•	Latency/Edge ≥ 3
	•	Emphasize Small Models at Edge and Hosting; show Edge/Offline lens prompts across grid.
	•	Clock‑speed ≥ 3
	•	Emphasize Speed‑to‑Value lens badges on Off‑the‑Shelf/API.

UI shows a small “Why highlighted?” tooltip that lists the triggering profile fields. No changes to scores or forced choices.

F) Content (ready to seed)

You already have eight option cards; we add two and tighten all copy to the consistent template. (I included new cards for Agents and Small Models at the Edge; the rest reuse/improve the text you have.)

New Card — Agentic Workflows & Orchestrators

What it is: Multi‑step LLM workflows that call tools/functions, plan subtasks, and verify steps.
Best for: Complex processes (intake → classify → retrieve → draft → QA); triage/assist in operations.
Not ideal when: Tasks must be fully deterministic or governed by strict audit trails.
Prerequisites: Clear tool APIs; guardrails; step‑wise evals; incident runbook.
Timeline: ⚡⚡ (weeks) · 🏗 med · 🏃‍♀️ med–high
Data needs: Tools and schemas; optional RAG.
Risks & safety: Cascading failures; prompt‑injection through tools; need kill‑switches.
KPIs: End‑to‑end success rate; intervention rate; regression of step accuracy.
Myth: “Agents are autonomous.”
Reality: Good agents are structured workflows with human‑set guardrails.

New Card — Small Models at the Edge

What it is: Deploying compact models on devices or near data sources to meet latency, privacy, or offline needs.
Best for: Field ops, manufacturing, retail POS, low‑latency UX.
Not ideal when: You need frontier model capabilities updated weekly.
Prerequisites: Model selection; on‑device runtime; update/rollback; telemetries.
Timeline: ⚡ (weeks–months) · 🏗 med · 🏃‍♀️ high
Data needs: Optional on‑device tuning; careful data minimization.
Risks & safety: Upgrade debt; inconsistent fleets; physical access risk.
KPIs: p95 latency; offline success rate; update failure rate.
Myth: “Edge = less safe.”
Reality: Different safety: you control environment; you also own patching and change control.

(I can deliver a JSON seed for all nine cards in your component schema if useful.)

Intro title: Options Studio — Understand Your AI Solution Patterns
Intro body: Explore common ways organizations use AI, the trade‑offs that matter, and where myths can mislead. We’ll highlight a few lenses based on your context. We won’t prescribe a choice.

Lenses legend:
	•	Speed‑to‑Value · Customization & Control · Data Leverage · Risk & Compliance Load · Operational Burden · Portability & Lock‑in · Cost Shape

Misconception Check heading: Five quick statements—True or False?

Reflection prompt 1: Which two options feel most promising to learn more about, and why?
Reflection prompt 2: Which lens mattered most for your situation?

Export CTA: Download your Options Studio Summary (PDF/JSON)

⸻

I) Two‑hour workshop integration (how facilitators use it)
	•	Minute 0–45: Context Profile + Pulse (CORTEX main).
	•	Minute 45–70: Options Studio (misconception check + explore RAG, Off‑the‑Shelf, Light FT).
	•	Minute 70–100: Results & gates discussion (bring back Risk/Ops gates surfaced by their profile).
	•	Minute 100–120: Capture two learning commitments (e.g., “pilot RAG on policy KB” or “stand up eval harness before any agents”). Export both the CORTEX snapshot and the Options Studio summary.

(Note: commitments are framed as learning steps, not projects.)

⸻

J) Acceptance criteria (what “done” looks like)
	1.	/decide renders the Intro → Misconception Check → Option Grid → Compare → Reflection → Export, without altering CORTEX scores.
	2.	Option cards display caution chips and lens highlights based on Context Profile; a tooltip explains why.
	3.	Compare view shows Seven Lenses visual + side‑by‑side bullets (no numeric totals).
	4.	Export includes: the use case (if entered), lenses highlighted, options viewed/compared, myths corrected, and reflections.
	5.	All copy uses plain, neutral tone; no vendor advice; no ROI claims.
	6.	Passes a11y checks (focus order, contrast, semantics).

⸻

K) Why this will actually help leaders
	•	Reframes choices as patterns with clear trade‑offs (not vendor shopping).
	•	Corrects the biggest myths up front.
	•	Personalizes emphasis (risk/edge/readiness) without prescribing.
	•	Leaves with a learning dossier, not a brittle recommendation.
	•	Builds shared vocabulary for ongoing decisions in their context.

If you want the JSON seed for all nine Option Cards and the Seven Lenses positions, I can provide that immediately so your developer can drop this in as a self‑contained page.
